mv-elsewhere
============

Move a list of directories, possibly piped from "find" to semewhere else preserving directory tree and attributes.

why
===

Do you know this huge volume with terabytes of OLD data mixed with working data? This script will help moving those files to another location just piping in whatever "find" tells is old.

why not bash?
============

It is possible to do it with bash, but it gets complicated with some "user named files",... with nice characters...
...And I have to learn python! ;)
